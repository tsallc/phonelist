# Project State

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-03 

## Current Focus

- Begin implementation of **Phase 1: Foundational Graph Schema & Temporal Logic** from `REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
- Create the necessary directories and files for the new schemas.

## Overall Progress

- **Plan:** `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` is defined.
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 (Starting)
- **Milestones Completed:**
    - Project analysis and refactoring plan creation (`REFACTOR_PLAN.md`).
    - LLM state tracking file creation (`PROJECT_STATE.md`).
    - Full codebase audit (`CODEBASE_AUDIT.md`).
- **Milestones Pending (Current Phase):**
    - Define Core Schemas (`src/schemas/directorySchemas.js`).
    - Refactor Data Source (`src/data/seedData.js`).
    - Prepare Service Layer Stubs (`src/services/directoryService.js`).

## Recent Activity

- Created `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Performed a full codebase audit and generated `CODEBASE_AUDIT.md`.
- Confirmed readiness to proceed with Phase 1 implementation.

## Next Steps

1.  **Create the directory `src/schemas/`.**
2.  Create the file `src/schemas/directorySchemas.js`.
3.  Define the `ContactEntity` schema within `src/schemas/directorySchemas.js` according to `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` (Section 3.1).

## Blockers/Issues

- None currently identified.

## Relevant Files & Context

- `REFACTOR_PLAN.md`: The guiding document for the refactoring effort.
- `CODEBASE_AUDIT.md`: Detailed analysis of the current codebase state.
- `src/App.jsx`: Represents the *current* state of the UI/component structure (pre-refactor).
- `src/ArtifactCode.jsx`: Represents the *current* state of the map component (pre-refactor).
- `src/schemas/directorySchemas.js`: (To be created) Will contain the new data schemas.
- `src/data/seedData.js`: (To be created/refactored) Will hold the data conforming to the new schemas.

## LLM Agent Instructions

- Refer to this file to understand the current state and immediate goals.
- Update `Last Updated`, `Recent Activity`, and `Next Steps` after completing a task or shifting focus.
- Use `Overall Progress` to maintain context within the larger plan (`REFACTOR_PLAN.md`).
